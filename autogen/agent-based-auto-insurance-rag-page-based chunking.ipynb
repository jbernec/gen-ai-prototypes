    "#### In this post, I will explore a page-based chunking strategy as part of a PoC for an autogen agent-driven RAG pipeline for processing auto insurance claims.\n",
    "#### RAG workflows have evolved as a new data stack that differs from traditional ETL. While it still involves data ingestion and processing like traditional ETL, it also adds new pipeline steps such as chunking, embedding, and loading data into a vector database.\n",
    "#### The main objective of these new RAG pipelines is to enable context-augmented LLM applications. \n",
    "#### In this notebook, I'll demonstrate how to leverage Azure AI Document Intelligence in conjunction with AzureOpenAI's multimodal GPT-4o model to extract and interpret data from auto insurance claims documents that feature intricate tables. I'll utilize a template form that includes detailed sections on accident location, incident description, involved vehicles, and injury information.\n",
    "#### In addition, I introduce two Autogen AI agents to demonstrate two agents, configured to collaborate and perform the search retrieval with a custom function, without a human in the loop setting. While still being able to respond to other queries outside of the provided private dataset context.\n",
    "#### I opted to implement a page-based chunking technique that relies on the markdown output of the Azure AI Document Intelligence sdk. The sdk extracts page content including tables into text and tabular markdown output format that maintains the page textual structure (like paragraphs and sections) and context. This technique also makes it easy to extract the page number per chunk.\n",
    "#### However, one of the potential drawbacks of this technique is that the integrity of a cross-page paragraph textual content or table could be degraded because the page chunk abruptly cuts off the content at the end of a page.\n",
    "#### In addition, I extracted all table objects and metadata separately and uploaded as one chunk.I will evaluate the results of the downstream llm agent responses against that the results from previous PoCs built uisng other strategies.\n",
    "#### I compare the responses to my sample questions against some ground truths, and so far, the answers are both accurate and relevant. Further refinement of the responses can be accomplished by applying additional preprocessing to the claims documents to better maintain context between the tables and associated texts. \n",
    "#### The claims files are in PDF format and contain tabular data.Azure AI Document Intelligence parses the table data into markdown-formatted tables, which can be chunked, indexed, uploaded to and queried over with a Azure AI Search index.\n",
    "#### The goal of this proof of concept is to demonstrate how insurance companies can expedite the process of extracting information from car accident insurance claim documents. This can be achieved without the need to manually read through each claims form.\n",
    "#### I set up autogen agents, incorporating a human-in-the-loop feature for automated chat interactions and responses.\n",
    "#### Out of the 6 questions, 4 were accurate, one was incomplete, and the last could not be answered.\n",

In the event of an accident, insurance can cover the costs of vehicle repairs, medical expenses, and other damages, reducing the financial burden on the individuals involved.\n\n2. **Legal Requirement**: Most states and countries have laws that require drivers to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance. This ensures that drivers can cover the costs of damages or injuries they may cause to others in an accident.\n\n3. **Liability Coverage**: Mandatory auto insurance ensures that drivers have liability coverage, which pays for damages and injuries to others if the policyholder is at fault in an accident. This helps protect other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.\n\n4. **Uninsured Motorist Protection**: By requiring auto insurance, the number of uninsured drivers on the road is reduced. This helps protect insured drivers from having to pay out-of-pocket for damages caused by uninsured motorists.\n\n5. **Peace of Mind**: Having auto insurance provides peace of mind to drivers, knowing that they are financially protected in case of an accident. This can reduce stress and anxiety associated with driving.\n\n6. **Public Safety**: Mandatory auto insurance contributes to overall public safety by ensuring that all drivers are financially responsible for their actions on the road. This can lead to safer driving behaviors and fewer accidents.\n\nIf you need more detailed information or specific legal requirements, please let me know!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

The impact caused damage to the rear bumper and trunk of my car. I was wearing my seatbelt and did not sustain any injuries, but I was shaken by the incident.Mark exited his vehicle to check on me, and we exchanged insurance information. I have attached a copy of the police report, which was filed at the scene, along with photographs of the damage to both vehicles.## INSURED VEHICLEYear2010Make HondaModel CivicV.I.N. 1HGCM82633A123456Plate7ABC123Extent of Damages Damage to rear bumper, Scratches on trunkPresent Location Impound LotDriver Emily Rodriguez(ASK IF OFFICER OF CO)Date of BirthMarch 15, 1991License No. D123456789State CA## OTHER VEHICLEYear 2020MakeFordModelTransit 250Extent of DamagesOwner Mark JohnsonDamage to front bumperPhone4152022020Address 305 Leavenworth StreetCity San FranciscoState CAZip94109AddressCityState Zip### Insurance InformationCompany NameXYZ InsurancePolicy No. 987654321Agent NameLisa CarterPhone (415) 555-9876## INJUREDNamePhoneAddressCityState ZipExtent of Injury## WITNESSESName Mia ChenPhone(415) 555-5678Address 5678 Beach StCity San Francisco## IMPACTIs damaged auto essential to business?NoHow?State CAZip 94123 \n\u001B[32m**********************************************************************\u001B[0m\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001B[33mAISearchAssistant\u001B[0m (to User):\n\nIn the accident that occurred on Lombard Street, Mark Johnson, who was driving a delivery van, is liable for the damages. The police report and the description of the accident indicate that Mark Johnson collided with the rear of Emily Rodriguez's vehicle. Typically, in rear-end collisions, the driver who hits the vehicle in front is considered at fault because they are expected to maintain a safe distance and be able to stop safely to avoid a collision.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001B[33mUser\u001B[0m (to AISearchAssistant):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001B[33mAISearchAssistant\u001B[0m (to User):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
