    "#### In this post, I will explore a page-based chunking strategy as part of a PoC for an autogen agent-driven RAG pipeline for processing auto insurance claims.\n",
    "#### RAG workflows have evolved as a new data stack that differs from traditional ETL. While it still involves data ingestion and processing like traditional ETL, it also adds new pipeline steps such as chunking, embedding, and loading data into a vector database.\n",
    "#### The main objective of these new RAG pipelines is to enable context-augmented LLM applications. \n",
    "#### In this notebook, I'll demonstrate how to leverage Azure AI Document Intelligence in conjunction with AzureOpenAI's multimodal GPT-4o model to extract and interpret data from auto insurance claims documents that feature intricate tables. I'll utilize a template form that includes detailed sections on accident location, incident description, involved vehicles, and injury information.\n",
    "#### In addition, I introduce two Autogen AI agents to demonstrate two agents, configured to collaborate and perform the search retrieval with a custom function, without a human in the loop setting. While still being able to respond to other queries outside of the provided private dataset context.\n",
    "#### I opted to implement a page-based chunking technique that relies on the markdown output of the Azure AI Document Intelligence sdk. The sdk extracts page content including tables into text and tabular markdown output format that maintains the page textual structure (like paragraphs and sections) and context. This technique also makes it easy to extract the page number per chunk.\n",
    "#### However, one of the potential drawbacks of this technique is that the integrity of a cross-page paragraph textual content or table could be degraded because the page chunk abruptly cuts off the content at the end of a page.\n",
    "#### In addition, I extracted all table objects and metadata separately and uploaded as one chunk.I will evaluate the results of the downstream llm agent responses against that the results from previous PoCs built uisng other strategies.\n",
    "#### I compare the responses to my sample questions against some ground truths, and so far, the answers are both accurate and relevant. Further refinement of the responses can be accomplished by applying additional preprocessing to the claims documents to better maintain context between the tables and associated texts. \n",
    "#### The claims files are in PDF format and contain tabular data.Azure AI Document Intelligence parses the table data into markdown-formatted tables, which can be chunked, indexed, uploaded to and queried over with a Azure AI Search index.\n",
    "#### The goal of this proof of concept is to demonstrate how insurance companies can expedite the process of extracting information from car accident insurance claim documents. This can be achieved without the need to manually read through each claims form.\n",
    "#### I set up autogen agents, incorporating a human-in-the-loop feature for automated chat interactions and responses.\n",
    "#### All 6 questions were accurately answered based on ground truth and human assessment of the documented information.\n",

In the event of an accident, the costs associated with vehicle repairs, medical expenses, and legal fees can be substantial. Insurance helps cover these costs, reducing the financial burden on the individuals involved.\n\n2. **Legal Requirement**: Most states and countries have laws that require drivers to carry a minimum amount of auto insurance. This ensures that all drivers have some level of financial responsibility in case of an accident.\n\n3. **Protection for Others**: Mandatory auto insurance ensures that if you cause an accident, the other party involved is compensated for their losses. This includes damage to their vehicle, medical expenses, and other related costs.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Insurance companies pool the risk of many drivers, which helps to spread the financial risk associated with accidents. This makes it more manageable for individuals, as the cost is shared among many policyholders.\n\n5. **Peace of Mind**: Having auto insurance provides peace of mind for drivers, knowing that they are protected financially in case of an accident. This can reduce stress and anxiety associated with driving.\n\n6. **Economic Stability**: By ensuring that drivers have insurance, it helps maintain economic stability. Without insurance, the costs of accidents could lead to significant financial hardship for individuals and potentially increase the burden on public resources.\n\nIn summary, mandatory auto insurance policies are in place to protect individuals, ensure financial responsibility, and maintain economic stability.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

The weather was foggy, and traffic was moving slowly due to congestion. As I approached a stop, I braked gently to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of me.\n\nSuddenly, I felt a jolt from behind as Mark Johnson, who was driving a delivery van (License Plate: 8XYZ456), collided with the rear of my vehicle.

The police report and the description of the accident indicate that Mark Johnson collided with the rear of Emily Rodriguez's vehicle. Typically, in rear-end collisions, the driver who hits the vehicle in front is considered at fault because they are expected to maintain a safe distance and be able to stop safely to avoid a collision.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001B[33mUser\u001B[0m (to AISearchAssistant):\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001B[33mAISearchAssistant\u001B[0m (to User):\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
