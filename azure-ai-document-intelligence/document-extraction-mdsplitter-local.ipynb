Continuity of care is the process of being treated by the same provider or medical team over a period of time. When you have continuity of care, your provider has a better understanding of your medical history, enabling them to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments.  \\nContinuity of care is important when selecting a provider because it ensures better quality of care. When you have continuity of care, your provider is more familiar with your medical history, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same provider for a period of time, the provider will be more likely to know about any changes in your health and can offer more personalized care.  \\nThe Northwind Health Plus plan offers coverage for continuity of care. This means that if you have been seeing the same provider for a period of time, you may be able to continue seeing them without having to switch to a different provider in the network.  \\nHowever, it's important to note that there are some exceptions to the continuity of care rule. If you are switching to a new provider, you may be required to switch to an in-network provider. Additionally, if you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of- network provider, you may be required to switch to an in-network provider.  \\nWhen selecting a provider, it's important to keep continuity of care in mind.

Ask your provider if they offer continuity of care.  \\n. If you are switching to a new provider, make sure they are familiar with your medical history.  \\n.

The allowed amount is the amount that your insurance company determines is a reasonable fee for a service. The amount you are billed for is the amount that the provider charges you for the services. With Northwind Health Plus, you are protected from balance billing. This means that you can rest assured that you will not be billed more than the allowed amount by your provider.  \\nBalance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus.

If you are considering receiving any of these services, it is important to check with Northwind Health Plus to determine whether balance billing protection applies.  \\nTips:  \\n1\\\\. Get preauthorization: When you are planning to receive a service, it is important to get preauthorization. Preauthorization will help you to determine if the service is covered and the amount that you will be responsible for.  \\n2\\\\. Ask questions: Ask your provider questions about the services they are providing and the cost of the services. This will help you to understand the costs associated with the services and to determine if balance billing protection applies.  \\n3\\\\.

Northwind Health Plus is responsible for informing you of your rights and for providing you with balance billing protection.  \\nBy taking the time to understand balance billing protection and to familiarize yourself with the tips above, you can help to ensure that you are not responsible for unexpected bills.

When you seek care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay more for services than you would if you had used an in-network option.  \\nWhen seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to know exactly what services are covered and what you will be expected to pay out of pocket. Generally, out-of-  \\nnetwork providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher.  \\nIt is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus.  \\nIn some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is not an in-network option available. In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider.  \\nWhen considering care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to understand the potential risks of doing so. You may end up paying more out of pocket because the provider is not contracted with Northwind Health Plus, or you may be subject to balance billing.  \\nIt is important to do your research before seeking care from an out-of-network provider. Make sure to ask questions about the provider's billing policies, cost of services, and any potential discounts. It is also important to call Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving care to make sure that the services are covered and to understand your financial responsibility.  \\nTips for seeking out-of-network care:  \\n. Ask the provider if they accept Northwind Health Plus and if they will accept the amount paid by the plan.  \\n. Ask the provider what their billing policies are and if they offer any discounts.  \\n· Ask Northwind Health Plus if the services are covered and if there are any limits or exclusions.  \\n· Ask Northwind Health Plus if you will be subject to balance billing.  \\n. Check to see if there is an in-network provider available that offers the same services.  \\nBy taking the time to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network care and by doing your research, you can make sure that you are making the best decisions for your health and your wallet.\"),\n",

Read reviews from past patients to get a better idea of their experience.  \\nBy taking the time to research your provider, you can ensure that you're getting the best care possible at the lowest cost.  \\nThere are also a few exceptions to be aware of.

This means that you will pay a lower copay for office visits than you would for other services. The split copay is applied to office visits with primary care physicians, specialists, and mental health providers.  \\nOffice visits with primary care physicians are subject to a $35 copay. Office visits with specialists are subject to a $60 copay. Mental health visits with a psychiatrist or another mental health provider are subject to a $45 copay.  \\nThere are a few exceptions to this split copay.

Office visits with an anesthesiologist are also not subject to the split copay and will be subject to the full copay amount that applies to the type of provider that you visited.  \\nWhen visiting your doctor, it is important to understand which type of provider you are visiting. Knowing whether you are visiting a primary care physician, specialist, or mental health provider will help you to understand how much your copay will be.

The amount you must pay out-of-pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered services is called the calendar year deductible. The calendar year deductible is the same for all members of the plan and is reset each year on the plan\\'s renewal date.  \\nFor In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. This means that you must pay the full cost of all covered services until you have paid a total of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. Once this amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services.  \\nFor Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of- network services. However, out-of-network services are subject to higher cost sharing than in-network services, so be sure to check with your provider to find out the cost sharing that applies.  \\nExceptions: Certain services are exempt from the calendar year deductible. These services include preventive care services and emergency services.  \\nTips:  \\n• Be sure to check with your provider to find out if a service is subject to the calendar year deductible before receiving the service.  \\n• Make sure you understand the cost sharing that applies to out-of-network services.  \\n• Be aware that the calendar year deductible is reset each year on the plan\\'s renewal date.  \\n• Remember that preventive care services and emergency services are exempt from the calendar year deductible.  \\nCoinsurance  \\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance  \\nCoinsurance is a cost-sharing requirement under Northwind Health Plus. This means that after you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the costs for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed amount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.  \\nFor example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you are responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the remaining amount of $80.  \\nCoinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits, preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services. However, coinsurance does not apply to some services, such as preventive care services.  \\nIt is important to understand the amount of coinsurance you are responsible for. Depending on the type of service, your coinsurance could be a percentage of the allowed amount or a fixed amount. This information should be provided to you in your plan documents.  \\nWhen you receive care, you will receive a bill that outlines the cost of the service and the amount you are responsible for paying. If you have met all of your deductibles and coinsurance requirements, the plan will pay the remaining costs.  \\nTips for Using Your Coinsurance:  \\n1\\\\. Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you may need. This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be better prepared for the cost.  \\n2\\\\. Consider using in-network providers when possible. Many plans offer lower coinsurance rates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service.  \\n3\\\\. Ask your provider for an estimate of the cost of a service before you receive it. This will help you determine how much of the cost you will be responsible for.  \\n4\\\\. Keep track of the services you receive and the amount you pay. This will help you understand how much you have paid towards your coinsurance requirement for the year.  \\n5\\\\. Contact your plan administrator if you have any questions about your coinsurance requirement or what services are subject to coinsurance.  \\nOut-Of-Pocket Maximum IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-Of-Pocket Maximum  \\nUnder the Northwind Health Plus plan, members are responsible for costs associated with their health care. These costs can include deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other out of pocket expenses. To help members manage health care costs, the Northwind Health Plus plan offers a maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) limit. Once a member has reached the OOP limit, they pay no more out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the plan year.'),\n",

This amount does not include premiums, balance-billed charges, or charges for non-covered services. The OOP maximum resets at the start of each plan year, meaning members have to start from scratch when the new plan year begins.  \\nThe OOP maximum applies to all services, including in-network and out-of-network services, except for non-covered services, balance-billed charges, and premium payments. This means that all in-network services and out-of-network services count towards the OOP maximum.  \\nExceptions  \\nThere are a few exceptions to the OOP maximum. For example, if a member seeks services from a provider that is not in-network, they may be balance-billed for the difference between what the provider charges and what Northwind Health Plus allows. Balance-billed charges do not count towards the OOP maximum.  \\nAnother exception is non-covered services. If a member receives a service that is not covered by the plan, they may be responsible for paying the full cost of the service. These services also do not count towards the OOP maximum.  \\nTips for Reaching the Out-of-Pocket Maximum  \\nReaching the OOP maximum can be a challenge, but there are a few tips that can help members get there.  \\nFirst, it's important to understand what services are covered by the plan and which are not. Northwind Health Plus covers a wide range of services, including preventive care, primary care, and specialty care. It's important to know which services are covered and which are not so members can make the most of their coverage.  \\nSecond, it's important to stay in-network as much as possible. Staying in-network helps members get the most out of their coverage and saves them money. In-network providers typically charge lower rates and provide a higher level of care than out-of-network providers.  \\nThird, it's important to understand the difference between deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Deductibles are the amount a member has to pay before the plan starts paying, copays are a set fee for services, and coinsurance is the percentage of the cost a member has to pay. Understanding these three terms can help members make more informed decisions about their care.  \\nFinally, it's important to take advantage of preventive care services. Preventive care services are covered at 100% by Northwind Health Plus and can help members stay healthy and avoid costly treatments and services down the road.  \\nReaching the out-of-pocket maximum can be a challenge, but with the right knowledge and tips, members can take advantage of their Northwind Health Plus plan and get the most out of their coverage.  \\nAllowed Amount  \\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Allowed Amount  \\nWhen receiving services under Northwind Health Plus, you are responsible for paying a portion of the cost of care. The portion of the cost that you are required to pay is known as the Allowed Amount. The Allowed Amount is the amount that the plan will pay towards the cost of care. The Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received.  \\nFor example, if you receive services from an in-network provider, the Allowed Amount may be lower than if you receive services from an out-of-network provider. The Allowed Amount also may vary depending on the type of service received. In general, preventive services such as physicals, immunizations, and screenings have lower Allowed Amounts than other types of care.  \\nYou should always check with the provider prior to receiving services to determine the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus will pay for the services you are receiving. This way, you will know what your financial responsibility will be and can plan accordingly.  \\nWhen you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay the full Allowed Amount up front. You then can submit a claim to Northwind Health Plus for reimbursement of the Allowed Amount less any applicable copays, coinsurance, or deductibles.  \\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may not cover services that are considered experimental or investigational. If a service is not covered, you may be responsible for the entire cost of the service. Therefore, it is important to check with Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving services to determine if a service is covered.  \\nIn addition, some services may be subject to pre-authorization or pre-certification. This means that you must obtain approval from Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving the service. If pre-authorization or pre-certification is not obtained, you may be responsible for the full cost of the services.  \\nIt is important to understand that the Allowed Amount does not include any applicable copays, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be due. It is also important to understand that the Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received and the type of provider that is providing the care. Therefore, it is important to check with the provider prior to receiving services to determine the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus will pay for the services you are receiving.  \\nFinally, it is important to keep track of your out-of-pocket expenses. This includes any copays, coinsurance, or deductibles that you may be required to pay.

Coordinating benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination helps to ensure that you don\\'t pay more than you should for your health care.  \\nWhen coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its allowed amount for the services you received. The secondary plan then pays the difference between what the primary plan paid and the total cost of the services.  \\nThe way in which you coordinate benefits will depend on the type of coverage you have.  \\nCoordinating Benefits with Medicare  \\nIf you have Medicare, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Northwind Health Plus is a secondary payer to Medicare, meaning that Medicare will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance after Medicare has paid its portion.  \\nIf you have Medicare, you will need to use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network to coordinate benefits with your Medicare coverage.

Your other employer plan will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance after the other employer plan has paid its portion.  \\nTo coordinate benefits with your other employer plan, you must use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network. You will need to provide your other employer plan\\'s information in order to coordinate benefits.  \\nExceptions  \\nThere are a few exceptions to coordinating benefits with other health care plans. For example, you cannot coordinate benefits with a health plan that is not a major medical plan. Also, if you are enrolled in a health plan that is a high-deductible plan, you cannot coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus until you have met the deductible.  \\nTips  \\nIf you have other health care coverage, here are a few tips to help you coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus:  \\n. Make sure you have your other health care plan\\'s information handy when you use Northwind Health Plus.  \\n. Always use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network to ensure that your benefits are coordinated correctly.  \\n. Make sure you understand your plan\\'s rules for coordinating benefits.  \\n· Ask your doctor or other health care provider about the cost of services before you receive them to make sure that you are not paying more than you should.  \\n. Read your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) carefully to make sure that your benefits are being coordinated correctly.  \\nBy understanding how to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus and other health care plans, you can make sure that you are getting the most out of your health care coverage.  \\nCOB Definitions WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?  \\nThe term \"Other Coverage\" is defined as any other insurance, health plan, or other coverage which provides benefits and services for medical care that is also provided under the Northwind Health Plus plan.

Northwind Health Plus will pay benefits only after the Other Coverage pays its benefits.  \\nTo understand how COB works, it is important to understand the following terms:  \\n· Primary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits first.  \\n· Secondary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits after the Primary Coverage has paid out its benefits.  \\n· Crossover Claims: These are claims that are submitted to both the Primary Coverage and the Secondary Coverage at the same time.  \\nIn order for Northwind Health Plus to serve as the Secondary Coverage, you must provide us with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that you receive from your Primary Coverage. This will help us determine the benefits that are available to you under Northwind Health Plus.  \\nFor Crossover Claims, you should submit the claim to both Northwind Health Plus and your Primary Coverage. You must provide Northwind Health Plus with a copy of the EOB for the Primary Coverage, as well as a copy of the claim that you submitted to your Primary Coverage. This will allow us to determine the benefits that are available to you under Northwind Health Plus.  \\nIt is important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not cover any expenses that are considered to be the responsibility of the Primary Coverage.

These exceptions include:  \\n. If you are covered by Medicare Part A and/or Part B, your other coverage is the primary payer and the Northwind Health Plus plan is the secondary payer.  \\n. If you are covered by Medicaid, your other coverage is the primary payer and the Northwind Health Plus plan is the secondary payer.  \\n. If you are covered by TRICARE, your other coverage is the primary payer and the Northwind Health Plus plan is the secondary payer.  \\n. If you are covered by a State Children\\'s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), your other coverage is the primary payer and the Northwind Health Plus plan is the secondary payer.  \\nTips  \\nIt\\'s important to know the primary and secondary rules of the Northwind Health Plus plan, and to understand any exceptions that may apply.

Following these tips can help you get the coverage you need and ensure that your claims are processed in a timely manner.  \\nCOB\\'s Effect On Benefits WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? - COB\\'s Effect On Benefits  \\nWhen you have more than one health insurance policy, the policies coordinate benefits through a process called Coordination of Benefits (COB). Coordination of Benefits is a process that helps to determine which plan pays first when there are multiple health plans  \\navailable. This process is important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket for care.  \\nWhen Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first), any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.  \\nThe amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service. Northwind Health Plus may pay up to the amount of the maximum allowable charge, which is the maximum amount the plan pays for a service.  \\nIf you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which plan is primary and which is secondary.  \\nWhen you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the benefits correctly.  \\nWhen you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the benefits correctly. It is important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not coordinate benefits with Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE programs.  \\nWhen coordinating benefits, there are a few important exceptions to keep in mind. If you are covered by a spouse\\'s health plan, the primary plan is usually the plan that covers the spouse and the secondary plan is usually the plan that covers you. Additionally, if you are covered by more than one group plan, the primary plan is usually the plan of the employer who has the most employees.  \\nFollowing these tips can help you understand how COB works and how to get the most out of your health coverage:  \\n· Understand the coverage of all of your health plans so that you know which plan is primary and which is secondary.  \\n· Contact your health care providers and make sure they are aware of all of your coverage and that they know how to coordinate benefits.  \\n. Keep copies of your insurance cards, letters from insurers, and other documents that explain your coverage.  \\n. Contact Northwind Health Plus if you have any questions or need help understanding how COB works.  \\nBy understanding your coverage and being aware of how COB works, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your health plan and that you are not paying more out of pocket than you need to.  \\nSubrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation and Reimbursement  \\nSubrogation and reimbursement are two important concepts to understand when it comes to Northwind Health Plus insurance. Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can seek reimbursement from another insurance company if you have secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northwind Health Plus and another insurance provider, Northwind Health Plus may be able to recoup the costs of medical services they paid for from the other insurance company.  \\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health Plus can reimburse you for certain medical expenses that you paid for out-of-pocket. This is beneficial if you received medical services that were not covered by Northwind Health Plus.  \\nWhen it comes to subrogation and reimbursement, it is important to note that Northwind Health Plus reserves the right to subrogate and reimburse any payments made for medical services. This includes payments made directly by you and other insurance companies. In the event that Northwind Health Plus is able to subrogate or reimburse payments, you will be notified of this before any funds are exchanged.  \\nWhen it comes to subrogation, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus will only seek reimbursement from another insurer if your primary insurance coverage does not cover the services that you received. This means that if your primary insurance covers the services that you received, Northwind Health Plus will not seek reimbursement.  \\nWhen it comes to reimbursement, there are certain exceptions to Northwind Health Plus\\'s policy. For example, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services that were covered by another insurance provider. Additionally, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services that you received from an out-of-network provider, unless the service was deemed medically necessary and was not available from an in-network provider.  \\nFinally, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus may require that you submit certain documentation in order to receive reimbursement. This documentation may include itemized bills, proof of payment, and/or medical records.  \\nIn order to ensure that you are able to take full advantage of Northwind Health Plus\\'s subrogation and reimbursement policy, it is important to keep detailed records of all medical services that you receive. This includes records of payments made by you, other insurance companies, and Northwind Health Plus. Additionally, it is important to keep a record of any documentation you submit to Northwind Health Plus to support your  \\nreimbursement claim. Keeping these records will help to ensure that you receive the full reimbursement that you are entitled to under the Northwind Health Plus policy.  \\nUninsured And Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?  \\nUninsured and Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage  \\nUninsured and Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) coverage is an optional form of coverage that may be included in Northwind Health Plus. This coverage will help protect you and your passengers if you\\'re injured in an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver.  \\nIf you have UM/UIM coverage, it will provide coverage for medical bills, lost wages, and other expenses that you may incur as a result of an accident. However, it is important to note that UM/UIM coverage only applies when the other driver is at fault, and does not cover damage to your vehicle or property.  \\nThere are a few exceptions to the coverage provided by UM/UIM coverage. For example, it does not cover intentional acts of another driver, damage caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver in a hit-and-run accident, or damage to your vehicle or property.  \\nIt is important to understand the limits of your UM/UIM coverage and any exclusions that may apply. You should make sure to review your policy thoroughly to ensure that you are properly covered.  \\nIn addition to understanding the limits of your coverage, there are other tips that you can use to help protect yourself in the event of an accident.  \\nFirst, make sure that you have a valid driver\\'s license and that the other driver does as well. It\\'s also important to make sure that the other driver has valid insurance coverage. You may want to ask to see proof of insurance before you get in the car.  \\nIf you do get into an accident, it\\'s important to stay calm and take down the other driver\\'s name, contact information, and insurance information. You should also call the police and make sure to file a police report. This will help provide evidence of the accident and can be used to pursue a claim with your insurance company.  \\nFinally, if you do find yourself in an accident, make sure to contact your Northwind Health Plus insurance provider as soon as possible to file a claim. Your insurance company will be able to help you understand the limits of your coverage and provide you with the resources you need to pursue a claim.  \\nHaving Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage through Northwind Health Plus can provide you and your passengers with peace of mind in the event of an accident.

This allows you to choose a provider that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.  \\nWhen you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an in-network provider.  \\nIt is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network  \\nservices. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive them from an out-of-network provider.  \\nWhen choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to make sure your provider is in-network.  \\nSecond, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers may be in-network but not be taking new patients.  \\nThird, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be difficult for you to get to your appointments.  \\nFinally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.  \\nChoosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan.  \\nContinuity of Care HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE  \\nAt Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a quality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. We also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all your health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care.  \\nContinuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to develop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in your health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping you to receive the best possible care.  \\nContinuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won't need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you've already had done.  \\nThere are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your insurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company and/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs.  \\nThere are a few tips you can follow to ensure you are taking full advantage of continuity of care and are getting the best, most affordable care possible. First, be sure to always keep your provider information up to date. If you move or change providers, be sure to notify your insurance company right away. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, be sure to check with your provider to understand any associated costs. Finally, if you are switching providers or insurance plans, make sure you get copies of your medical records from your previous provider.  \\nAt Contoso, we strive to provide our employees with access to quality, affordable health care. We are proud to offer Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides continuity of care, helping you to receive the best possible care and save money on health care costs.  \\nNon-Participating Non-Participating Providers and How They Affect Your Costs  \\nWhen selecting a health care provider, it is important to understand the differences between participating and non-participating providers. Participating providers are those who have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan's set rates. Non- participating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can charge the patient more than what the health plan pays.  \\nWhen you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider's actual charges and the amount the plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your provider's policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to discuss this with your provider prior to receiving services.  \\nAdditionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of- pocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider. For example, if your provider's charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the remaining $100 balance billing amount.\"),\n",
       "  Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS', 'Header 3': 'Exceptions'}, page_content=\"There are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating providers' charges if there are no participating providers in your area.  \\nTips  \\nIn order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.  \\nIt is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill you after the health plan pays them.  \\nWhen selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.  \\nFinally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service. Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.  \\nBalance Billing Protection  \\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS - Balance Billing Protection  \\nAt Contoso, we understand that medical costs can be intimidating and confusing, which is why we've partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees the Northwind Standard plan. This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers.  \\nWhat is balance billing?  \\nBalance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance billing when visiting in-network providers.  \\nWhat is an in-network provider?  \\nIn-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan's payment terms. Visiting an in-network provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network providers on the Northwind Health website.  \\nWhat if I visit an out-of-network provider?  \\nVisiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing. Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in- network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.  \\nTips to avoid balance billing:  \\n· Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.  \\n. Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any services.  \\n· Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network.  \\n· Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time.  \\n. If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance company to negotiate a lower cost.  \\nExceptions to the balance billing protection:  \\n· Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.  \\n. Balance billing protection does not apply to mental health and substance abuse coverage.  \\n· Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers.  \\n· Balance billing protection is not applicable to any non-covered services.  \\nAt Contoso, we want to make sure our employees are provided with the best coverage options. That's why we've partnered with Northwind Health to offer the Northwind Standard plan, which provides balance billing protection when visiting in-network providers. We encourage our employees to use the tips provided to help reduce the risk of unexpected costs when visiting a provider.  \\nBenefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers  \\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers  \\nOne of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.  \\nUnder Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.  \\nIn-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.  \\nOut-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with Northwind Health. As a result, they are not required to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the cost. Additionally, out-of-network providers may not offer additional services or discounts that are available to in-network providers.  \\nWhen choosing a provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is in-network. While it is possible to receive care from out-of-network providers, it is important to understand that you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is recommended that you choose an in-network provider whenever possible.  \\nThere are some exceptions when it comes to receiving care from out-of-network providers. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, you may receive care from an out- of-network provider. In these cases, the cost of care may be more expensive and you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.  \\nIn addition to understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, it is important to understand the cost sharing associated with each. Northwind Standard does not cover the full cost of care for out-of-network providers, so you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.  \\nWhen choosing a provider, it is important to take into account the cost sharing associated with each provider. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.  \\nFinally, it is important to be aware of any additional fees that may be associated with receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Some providers may charge additional fees for services that are not covered by Northwind Standard. It is important to ask about any additional fees before receiving care from an out-of-network provider to make sure you are aware of any additional costs you may be responsible for.  \\nBy understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, as well as the cost sharing associated with each, you can make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses. While it is possible to receive care from an out-of- network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.

Contacting the provider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for Northwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you'll be paying for services.

       "  Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION'}, page_content=\"Copayments (Copays) IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)  \\nAt Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan includes copayments (copays) for certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay at the time of service, and it is generally a lower amount than what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost of the service.  \\nCopays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive. Generally speaking, copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits. For example, copays for office visits with a primary care physician may be $20, while copays for a hospital visit may be up to $150. It is important to note that the copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to state.  \\nIn addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, such as prescriptions and diagnostic testing. For example, copays for generic prescription drugs may be $10, while copays for brand-name drugs may be $35. Copays for diagnostic testing, such as lab tests and X-rays, may range from $20 to $100 depending on the type of test.  \\nIt is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover certain services, such as emergency services and mental health and substance abuse services. For these services, you may be responsible for the full cost of the service, so it is important to understand your plan and read the fine print before receiving any services.  \\nIn addition to copays, you may also be charged coinsurance for certain services. Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that you are responsible for paying. Generally speaking, coinsurance rates are lower than copays, so it is important to understand the difference between the two.  \\nFinally, there are some exceptions to the copayment rules. For example, preventive care services may be covered at no cost to you. This includes routine physical exams, immunizations, and screenings for certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes.  \\nOverall, copays are a great way to save money on health care services. Understanding your plan and reading the fine print can help you to save money on health care services. It is also important to remember that copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to state, so it is important to do your research before receiving any services.  \\nSplit Copay For Office Visits  \\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits  \\nAt Northwind Health, we understand how important it is to have access to quality, affordable healthcare. That's why we provide our members with Split Copay for Office Visits under the Northwind Standard plan. With this benefit, you can expect to pay a set copayment for office visits, regardless of the provider you visit.  \\nWhat is Split Copay for Office Visits?  \\nSplit Copay for Office Visits is a feature of the Northwind Standard plan that allows you to pay a set copayment for most office visits. This copayment covers both the provider and the facility charges for office visits. The amount of the copayment will depend on the type of provider you visit, such as a primary care physician or specialist.  \\nWho is eligible for Split Copay for Office Visits?  \\nAll members of the Northwind Standard plan are eligible for Split Copay for Office Visits. This benefit is available to all members, regardless of where they live or work.  \\nAre there any exceptions?  \\nYes, there are some exceptions to the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit.

You can check your plan's directory of providers for more information.  \\n. Many providers are now offering virtual visits, which can be a great way to access care without having to leave the comfort of your home.  \\n· Make sure to bring your insurance card to every appointment. That way, you can make sure that your copayment is applied correctly.  \\n. If you have any questions about the cost of your office visit, don't hesitate to ask your provider's office. They should be able to tell you exactly how much you can expect to pay for the visit.  \\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing our members with access to quality, affordable healthcare. We hope that the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit will make it easier for you to get the care you need.  \\nCalendar Year Deductible IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible  \\nThe Northwind Standard plan has a calendar year deductible of $2,000 for each individual and $4,000 for each family. A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies.  \\nHowever, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally, prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per individual and $500 per family.  \\nIt is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.  \\nTips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible  \\nMeeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.  \\nFirst, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible without paying out of pocket.  \\nSecond, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are not paying more than you have to for services.  \\nThird, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs.  \\nFinally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket.  \\nBy following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.  \\nCoinsurance IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance  \\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For  \\nexample, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.  \\nUnder Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%.  \\nIt's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services.  \\nWhen you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It's also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of- network services.  \\nIt's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost.  \\nIf you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.  \\nFinally, it's important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of- pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services.  \\nIn summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It's important to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of-network services. Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your out-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed.\"),\n",

It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any amount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a percentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed amount.  \\nIn general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed Amount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount.  \\nIt is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a service. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if it is more than the Allowed Amount.\"),\n",

You will be able to use in-network providers for your surgery, as long as it\\'s deemed medically necessary by your doctor.  \\nThe amount of coverage you receive for surgery depends on the type of surgery you need. Generally, simple and routine surgeries are covered at 100%, while major or complex surgeries may be covered at a lower rate. You can check with your insurance provider to learn more about the coverage for specific surgeries.  \\nBefore you receive surgery, you\\'ll need to get pre-authorization from your insurance provider. Pre-authorization means that your insurance provider has approved the surgery and the amount of coverage you\\'ll receive. If you don\\'t get pre-authorization, you may be responsible for all the costs of the surgery.  \\nYou\\'ll also need to make sure that you have a referral from your primary care physician if you\\'re seeing a specialist for surgery. If you don\\'t have a referral, your insurance provider may not cover the cost of the surgery.  \\nIf you need to stay overnight in a hospital after your surgery, your Northwind Standard plan will cover the cost of the hospital stay. However, you may have to pay a copay for each day you stay in the hospital.  \\nIn some cases, you may need to pay for part of the cost of the surgery. This is called coinsurance, which is a percentage of the cost that you pay out-of-pocket. The coinsurance rate for surgeries is usually around 20%, but it can vary depending on the type of surgery and the insurance provider.  \\nSome types of surgery are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These may include cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and any type of experimental surgery. You\\'ll need to check with your insurance provider to find out which surgeries are covered and which are not.  \\nWhen it comes to surgery, it\\'s important to plan ahead and make sure that you understand your insurance coverage. Make sure to get pre-authorization, get a referral from your primary care physician, and get an estimate of the cost of the surgery. This will help ensure that your surgery is covered and that you\\'re not left with unexpected costs.  \\nSurgical Center Care - Outpatient Surgical Center Care - Outpatient  \\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that having access to quality and affordable care is important. That\\'s why we offer coverage for surgical center care - outpatient services in our Northwind Standard plan.  \\nWhen it comes to surgical center care, Northwind Health provides coverage for procedures that require care at an outpatient surgical center. This includes surgery, as well as related services, such as lab tests, x-rays, and certain medications. This coverage is subject to certain restrictions, such as prior authorization, medical necessity, and applicable copayments or coinsurance.  \\nIt\\'s important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover services provided in a hospital outpatient department. If you need care in a hospital outpatient setting, you will need to pay the full cost of the services not covered.  \\nIf you need a surgical procedure, your primary care physician will likely refer you to a specialist who can provide the care you need. Make sure to ask questions and get all the information you need before you have your procedure. Also, make sure to check if the specialist is in-network with Northwind Health. That way, you can be sure that your procedure will be covered by your plan.  \\nWhen you visit the surgical center, you may be asked to sign a form acknowledging that you are responsible for any costs that are not covered by your plan. It\\'s important to read this form carefully, so you know what you\\'re agreeing to.  \\nIf you need to have a procedure done at an outpatient surgical center, make sure to contact Northwind Health beforehand. You can call our customer service team at 1-800-555-1234 and they will help you understand what services are covered by your plan and how to get the care you need.  \\nAt Northwind Health, we are committed to providing quality and affordable health care services.

TMJ care is the diagnosis and management of disorders of the temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull. TMJ care can include diagnostics such as x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and other tests or treatments, including physical therapy, medications, and surgery.  \\nThe Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain TMJ treatments and services, such as treatment for bruxism, TMJ splint therapy, or orthodontic treatment. Additionally, any services or treatments that are deemed to be experimental or investigational are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan.  \\nEmployees with this plan should be aware that they may be subject to preauthorization requirements when seeking TMJ care. Preauthorization is a process in which a health insurance company reviews the medical necessity of a treatment or procedure prior to authorizing payment. This means that the employee must obtain approval from the insurance company before receiving the treatment or procedure.  \\nWhen seeking TMJ care, it is important for the employee to discuss their condition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can recommend specific treatments and services that are appropriate for the employee\\'s condition and can help the employee understand if their treatment is covered by the Northwind Standard plan. It is also important for the employee to understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment. This includes any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be applicable.  \\nIn addition to discussing treatment options with their healthcare provider, employees should also be proactive in managing their TMJ condition. This includes avoiding activities that can exacerbate the problem, such as grinding teeth or chewing gum, and practicing relaxation techniques to reduce stress. Additionally, employees should practice good posture and avoid sleeping on their stomach to reduce strain on the jaw. Practicing good  \\noral hygiene is also important, as TMJ can be caused by dental problems such as misalignment of the teeth.  \\nFinally, employees should be aware that TMJ is a chronic condition, which means that it may require ongoing management. Regular visits to the healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment may be necessary in order to manage the condition. Employees should also be aware that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover all TMJ treatments, so it is important to understand their financial responsibility for any treatment that is not covered.  \\nIn conclusion, the Northwind Standard plan does provide coverage for TMJ care, but there may be certain treatments and services that are not covered. It is important for employees to understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment, and to discuss their condition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. Additionally, it is important for employees to practice good posture, avoid activities that can exacerbate the problem, and practice good oral hygiene in order to manage their TMJ condition.'),\n",

With Northwind Standard, employees can also choose from a variety of in-network providers for their care. However, in order to get the most out of their benefit coverage, employees should be aware of the prior-authorization process for certain services and treatments.  \\nPrior-authorization is a process in which Northwind Health requires Contoso\\'s employees to get approval from their plan before receiving certain services or treatments. This process helps ensure that the care is necessary and medically appropriate. If prior-authorization is not obtained, the employee may be responsible for the full cost of any services or treatments that are received without approval.  \\nSome services or treatments that may require prior-authorization include, but are not limited to, hospital stays, certain medical procedures, durable medical equipment, and certain prescription drugs. In order to obtain prior-authorization, the employee\\'s physician must submit a request to Northwind Health. The request will then be reviewed by Northwind Health to determine if the service or treatment is medically necessary and if it is a covered benefit under the Northwind Standard plan.  \\nIn some cases, Northwind Health may also require that the employee meet certain criteria in order to be approved for a service or treatment. These criteria may include specific medical tests or treatments, lifestyle changes, or other requirements. If the employee is unable to meet the criteria, prior-authorization may not be granted.  \\nThere are some exceptions to the prior-authorization process. For example, preventive care services and emergency services are not subject to prior-authorization. In addition, mental health and substance abuse coverage is not subject to prior-authorization. However, out-of- network services are subject to prior-authorization and may require additional cost to the employee.  \\nHere are some tips for Contoso\\'s employees to help them navigate the prior-authorization process:  \\n· Contact your physician\\'s office to determine if prior-authorization is required before receiving a service or treatment.  \\n· Contact Northwind Health to determine if a service or treatment is a covered benefit under Northwind Standard.  \\n· Ask your physician to submit a request for prior-authorization as soon as possible.  \\n· Understand the criteria that may be required for prior-authorization and be prepared to meet those criteria if necessary.  \\n· Be aware of any exceptions to the prior-authorization process, such as preventive care and emergency services.  \\nBy understanding the prior-authorization process and following these tips, Contoso\\'s employees can ensure that they get the most out of their benefit coverage.  \\nExceptions To Prior Authorization For Benefit Coverage CARE MANAGEMENT: Exceptions To Prior Authorization For Benefit Coverage  \\nAt Northwind Health, we understand the importance of providing quality care for our members.

We understand that there are circumstances when the care needed is not available through an in-network provider, and so we make exceptions to the prior-authorization requirement.  \\nFirst and foremost, it\\'s important to note that prior authorization is not required for emergency services. If you find yourself in an emergency situation, you can immediately seek out the care you need without worrying about getting prior authorization.  \\nIn addition, prior authorization is not necessary for emergency services provided in a foreign country. This includes both medical and dental services. However, it\\'s important to  \\nremember that Northwind Standard does not cover out-of-network services in foreign countries.  \\nIn rare cases, prior authorization may also be waived for services that are not available in- network. If the care you need is not available through an in-network provider, you can seek out an out-of-network provider without obtaining prior authorization. However, you should be aware that you may be responsible for any costs associated with out-of-network services.  \\nIn order to ensure that you are receiving the best care possible, it\\'s important to understand the basics of prior authorization. Prior authorization is a process in which your insurance company reviews the request and verifies the need for the service or procedure. This helps to ensure that you receive the appropriate care and that the costs associated with the care are covered by your plan.  \\nIf you\\'re considering seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it\\'s important to remember that prior authorization is required for out-of-network services. You should call Northwind Health to obtain prior authorization before you receive care from an out-of- network provider.  \\nIt\\'s also important to know that prior authorization may be denied if the service or procedure is not medically necessary or not covered under your plan. If prior authorization is denied, you may be responsible for any costs associated with the care.  \\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that there are times when care is not available through an in-network provider. That\\'s why we make exceptions to the prior-authorization requirement for certain services and procedures. However, it\\'s important to remember that prior authorization is still required for most out-of-network services.  \\nIf you have any questions about prior authorization for out-of-network providers, please contact Northwind Health.

These services include clinical review, which is a process that evaluates the medical necessity and appropriateness of a proposed course of treatment, as well as any adjustment or changes to existing treatments.  \\nClinical review is conducted by Northwind Health\\'s Medical Management Department, which is staffed by licensed clinicians who are experienced in the various medical conditions and treatments that are covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These clinicians use evidence-based guidelines and other important criteria to evaluate the proposed course of treatment and make sure that it is medically necessary and appropriate.  \\nNorthwind Health utilizes a three-level clinical review process. The first level of review involves a Registered Nurse (RN) or Medical Doctor (MD) evaluating the proposed course of treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary, then the case is approved and the member can proceed with the treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is not medically necessary, then the case is referred to the next level of review.  \\nAt the second level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Director, who is an MD or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). The Medical Director reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or not. If the Medical Director approves the case, then the member can proceed with the treatment. If the Medical Director does not approve the case, then the case is referred to the third level of review.  \\nAt the third and final level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Review Officer, who is an MD or DO. The Medical Review Officer reviews the case and makes a final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or not. If the Medical Review Officer approves the case, then the member can proceed with the treatment. If the Medical Review Officer does not approve the case, then the member is not eligible to receive the treatment.  \\nThe Northwind Standard plan also offers several exceptions to the clinical review process. For example, certain types of medical services are exempt from clinical review and can be approved without going through the process. Additionally, certain time-sensitive services may be approved without going through the clinical review process if the member\\'s health is in immediate danger.  \\nIt is important for members to understand the clinical review process and the exceptions that are available. Members should be aware that some medical services may require pre- authorization before they can be approved, and that the clinical review process may take some time. Additionally, members should keep in mind that the clinical review process is designed to ensure that medically necessary treatments are provided in a timely and cost- effective manner.  \\nTo help ensure that the clinical review process runs smoothly and quickly, members should provide accurate and detailed information about their medical needs when requesting treatment. This includes a complete list of their current medications, as well as all relevant medical history. Additionally, members should provide any necessary documentation that may be required, such as test results or lab reports. Finally, members should make sure that they understand the process and any exceptions that may apply.  \\nOverall, the clinical review process is an important component of the Northwind Standard plan, and it helps to ensure that members receive high-quality, cost-effective care. The process is designed to be straightforward and efficient, and the exceptions that are available can help to ensure that members receive the care they need in a timely manner. By  \\nunderstanding the clinical review process and the exceptions that are available, members can help to ensure that they receive the care they need in a timely and cost-effective manner.  \\nPersonal Health Support Programs CARE MANAGEMENT  \\nAt Northwind Health, we understand that making sure you get the care you need is an essential part of your overall health.

       "  Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?'}, page_content='Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?  \\nCoordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans  \\nIt may be possible to coordinate benefits with other health care plans if you have other coverage. Coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan towards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total charges for the service.  \\nIf you have other coverage, such as Medicare or an employer-sponsored health plan, the Northwind Standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. This can help reduce your out-of-pocket costs for health care services.  \\nHow Do I Coordinate Benefits with Other Plans?  \\nIf you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to determine how to coordinate benefits. Depending on the plans you have, you may be able to coordinate benefits by filing a claim with both plans.  \\nYou will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the Northwind Health plan. The EOB is a summary of the services you received and how much the Northwind Health plan paid for those services.  \\nWhen filing a claim with the other health care plan, you may also need to provide a copy of your bill or invoice. The other plan may require additional information as part of the claim process.  \\nYou should keep copies of all documentation that you submit to the other plan. This can help you track your claim and follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in processing.  \\nExceptions  \\nCoordination of benefits with other plans is not available for all types of services. For example, coordination of benefits will not be available for services related to emergency care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, or services received from out-of- network providers.  \\nTips for Coordinating Benefits  \\n· Contact your other health care plan to determine whether you can coordinate benefits and what documentation you need to provide.  \\n. Keep copies of all documentation you submit to the other plan, including bills and invoices.  \\n. Follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in processing the claim.  \\n. Be sure to read all of the plan documents and understand your coverage options.  \\n. If you have any questions, contact the Northwind Health customer service team for assistance.  \\nCOB Definitions WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?  \\nAt Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage. COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more than one health plan.  \\nWhen an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee\\'s primary health plan pays  \\nfirst, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.  \\nUnder the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost. However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind Standard network will not be covered by the plan.  \\nWhen you receive health care services, it\\'s important to identify all of your coverage to the provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.  \\nWhen you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you\\'ll need to include information about the other coverage you have. If the claim is sent to Northwind Standard before any other plan, the claim will be processed based on the Northwind Standard plan benefits.  \\nIt\\'s important to remember that Northwind Standard does not coordinate benefits with other coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. If a provider has been paid by another plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind Standard pays its portion of the claim.  \\nIf you have other coverage, it\\'s important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure you are taking full advantage of your coverage. If you need help understanding your plan benefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits, please contact the Northwind Standard Plan Customer Service team. We\\'re here to help!  \\nPrimary And Secondary Rules WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?  \\nIf you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse\\'s plan, Northwind Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.  \\nThe primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying the largest portion of your healthcare costs.  \\nFor example, if you have a spouse\\'s health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse\\'s plan would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This means that your spouse\\'s plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.  \\nIt\\'s important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses  \\nthat exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000 deductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from the primary plan will be paid.  \\nThere are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D will be the secondary coverage.  \\nIt\\'s also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as \"creditable coverage,\" and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses once the primary plan has paid.  \\nWhen it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it\\'s important to remember that each health plan is different. Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage.  \\nFinally, if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, be sure to reach out to Northwind Health. Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage.  \\nCOB\\'s Effect On Benefits WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?  \\nWhen you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical expenses. The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the company that pays second is called the secondary payer.'),\n",
       "  Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?', 'Header 3': 'Coordination of Benefits Exceptions'}, page_content='There are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans\\' health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind Standard may pay first.  \\n#### Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits  \\nWhen COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the secondary payer may pay nothing.  \\nFor example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.  \\nTips for Working with COB  \\nWhen you have multiple health insurance plans, it\\'s important to understand how COB works and how it can affect your benefits. Here are a few tips to help you manage your benefits:  \\n· Make sure that each insurance company has all of the necessary information about your other coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.  \\n· Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each other.  \\n· Ask your health care providers to submit claims to both insurance companies.  \\n. Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits.  \\n. If you have questions, contact each insurance company for clarification.  \\nOverall, it\\'s important to understand how COB works and how it affects your benefits. By being aware of the rules and exceptions, you can ensure that you are getting the full coverage you need from both insurance companies.  \\nSubrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation And Reimbursement  \\nWhen you have other health coverage, such as Medicare or another employer\\'s health plan, Northwind Standard may still provide coverage in certain circumstances. This is called \"subrogation and reimbursement.\" Subrogation and reimbursement works when another health plan pays for a service that is covered by Northwind Standard. In this case, Northwind Standard will pay for the same service, assuming that it was medically necessary and you received it from an in-network provider.  \\nIf Northwind Standard pays for a service that is already covered by your other health plan, you may be responsible for reimbursing Northwind Standard. This can happen if you do not provide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage.  \\nThere are certain exceptions to subrogation and reimbursement. If you are a Medicare beneficiary, Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from Medicare. In addition, Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from any other health plan if the service you received is not covered by the other health plan.  \\nWhen filing claims, it is important to keep in mind that you need to provide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage. This can include a copy of your other plan\\'s  \\nExplanation of Benefits (EOB) or a letter from the other health plan stating that the service is not covered.  \\nWhen providing proof of other coverage, it is important to remember to include the following information:  \\n· Your name, address, and policy number  \\n· The name of the other health plan  \\n· The date of service for the claim  \\n· The amount paid by the other health plan  \\n· Any additional information required by Northwind Standard  \\nIf you are unsure of what information to provide, you can always contact Northwind Standard for assistance.  \\nIt is also important to remember that if you are filing claims with both Northwind Standard and another health plan, you must submit a claim to Northwind Standard first.

Generally, the venue for a claim is the place where the injury or illness occurred, or the place where the services were rendered.  \\nIn cases where the injury or illness occurs in multiple states or counties, the venue will typically be the state or county where the majority of the services were rendered. Claims for services rendered outside of the United States should be filed in the state or country in which the services were rendered.  \\nWhen filing a claim with Northwind Health, it is important to note that any disputes concerning the claim must be resolved in the state where the claim was filed, according to the state's laws. The claim cannot be resolved in any other state or country.  \\nTips  \\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when filing a claim with Northwind Health:  \\n. Always keep the location of the service in mind when filing a claim.  \\n. Make sure to include the appropriate state or country on the claim form.  \\n. Always provide detailed information about the services that were rendered, including the date, time, and location.  \\n. Make sure to include any relevant medical records or other documentation with the claim.  \\n· When possible, make sure to file the claim in the same state or county where the services were rendered.  \\n· In cases where the services were rendered in multiple states or counties, make sure to file the claim in the state or county where the majority of the services were rendered.  \\n· Disputes concerning the claim must be resolved in the state where the claim was filed, according to the state's laws.  \\n. If the services were rendered outside of the United States, make sure to file the claim in the state or country in which the services were rendered.  \\nWomen's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998  \\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998  \\nThe Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) is a federal law that provides rights and protections to people receiving mastectomies, a surgery to remove all or part of the breast. Under this law, health plans, including Northwind Standard, must provide coverage for mastectomies, reconstructive surgery, and other related medical services that are required by the attending physician in connection with a mastectomy.  \\nThe WHCRA applies to all group health plans, including Northwind Standard, and health insurance issuers that offer group health plans. This law requires all group health plans, such as Northwind Standard, to provide coverage for reconstructive surgery and other related medical services when it is medically necessary to reconstruct the breast or to treat physical complications of the mastectomy.  \\nNot all mastectomies will qualify for WHCRA coverage. For example, mastectomies that are done for cosmetic reasons or for the treatment of a non-invasive breast cancer (i.e. Ductal Carcinoma in situ) are not covered under WHCRA.  \\nIn order for the coverage to be effective, the attending physician must provide written certification that the mastectomy was medically necessary. The certification should include a description of the medical condition, the type of mastectomy performed, and the type of reconstructive surgery required. The attending physician must also certify that the mastectomy was performed for medical reasons and not for reasons of cosmetic enhancement.  \\nWhen the attending physician provides the written certification, the plan must provide coverage for the mastectomy and any reconstructive surgery that is required. The coverage must include all stages of reconstruction, prostheses, and other supplies related to the reconstruction. The plan must also provide coverage for physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema, which is a condition that causes swelling due to a buildup of lymph fluid in the affected area.  \\nIn addition, the plan must provide coverage for outpatient services, such as physical therapy and counseling, that are related to the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery. The plan must also provide coverage for ancillary services that are related to the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery, such as ambulance services, durable medical equipment, and prosthetic devices.  \\nUnder the WHCRA, the coverage must be provided without imposing any additional costs or restrictions on the patient. This means that the patient should not have to pay any additional coinsurance, copayment, or deductible for the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery.  \\nThe WHCRA also provides rights for women who have already had mastectomies. If a woman has already had a mastectomy and the plan does not cover reconstructive surgery or medically related services, the plan must provide coverage for those services if the attending physician certifies that the services are medically necessary.  \\nFinally, the WHCRA provides certain rights for women who are considering having a mastectomy. In particular, the law requires that all group health plans provide a written notice to women about the coverage that is available under the plan for mastectomies and reconstructive surgery. This notice must be provided at the time of enrollment in the plan and at least annually thereafter.  \\nThe WHCRA provides important rights and protections to women who have had, or are considering having, a mastectomy. It is important for employees to understand their rights and to make sure that their health plan is providing the coverage that is required by the law.  \\nWorkers' Compensation Insurance  \\nOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Workers' Compensation Insurance  \\nAt Contoso, we are committed to providing our employees with a safe and productive work environment.

If the cost of medical treatment exceeds the amount of coverage purchased, the employee may be responsible for the remaining balance.  \\nFinally, employees should be aware that Workers' Compensation Insurance is regulated by state and federal laws. Depending on the state, employees may have the right to receive legal representation or to appeal denied claims. In some states, employees may have the right to choose their own physician or to receive benefits for permanent disabilities.  \\nAt Contoso, we are committed to providing our employees with a safe and productive work environment, and we take the necessary steps to ensure that our Workers' Compensation Insurance coverage meets all state and federal requirements.

It is a compilation of stories depicting the interactions between science and wonder, and I am pleased to share this visually stunning and captivating exploration of our home planet.  \\nFrom space, our Earth looks tranquil. The blue ethereal vastness of the oceans harmoniously shares the space with verdant green land-an undercurrent of gentle- ness and solitude. But spending time gazing at the images presented in this book, our home planet at night instantly reveals a different reality. Beautiful, filled with glow- ing communities, natural wonders, and striking illumination, our world is bustling with activity and life.  \\nDarkness is not void of illumination. It is the contrast, the area between light and dark, that is often the most illustrative. Darkness reminds me of where I came from and where I am now-from a small town in the mountains, to the unique vantage point of the Nation\\'s capital. Darkness is where dreamers and learners of all ages peer into the universe and think of questions about themselves and their space in the cosmos. Light is where they work, where they gather, and take time together.  \\nNASA\\'s spacefaring satellites have compiled an unprecedented record of our Earth, and its luminescence in darkness, to captivate and spark curiosity. These missions see the contrast between dark and light through the lenses of scientific instruments. Our home planet is full of complex and dynamic cycles and processes. These soaring observers show us new ways to discern the nuances of light created by natural and human-made sources, such as auroras, wildfires, cities, phytoplankton, and volcanoes.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"x\" -->  \\nScience not only changes what we know, but also how we think about our place in the cosmos.

The stars and the Moon provide illumination that differs from, and complements, daylight. Natural Earth processes such as volcanic eruptions, auroras, lightning, and meteors entering the atmosphere generate localized visible light on timescales ranging from subsecond (lightning), to days, weeks (forest fires), and months (volcanic eruptions).  \\nMost interesting and unique (as far as we know) to Earth, is the nighttime visible illumination emitted from our planet that is associated with human activities. Whether purposefully designed to banish darkness (such as lighting for safety, industrial activities, commerce, and transportation) or a secondary result of (such as gas flares associated with mining and hydrocarbon extraction activities, or nocturnal commercial fishing), anthro- pogenic sources of nighttime light are often broadly distributed in space and sustained in time-over years and even decades. Because these light sources are inextricably tied to human activities and societies, extensive and long-term measurement and monitoring of Earth\\'s anthropogenic nocturnal lights can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of our species and the ways in which society is changing-and is changed by-the environment on a wide range of time scales.  \\nOver the past four decades, sensitive imaging instruments have been operated on low-Earth-orbiting satellites to measure natural and human-caused visible nocturnal illumination, both reflected and Earth-generated. The satellite sensors provide unique imagery: global coverage yet with high spatial resolution, and frequent measurements over long periods of time.  \\nThe combined, multisatellite global nocturnal illumination dataset contains a treasure trove of unique information about our planet and our species-and the  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"xii\" -->  \\ninteractions between society and natural processes. Beyond academic study, Earth nightlight measurements are being used to help save lives and property around the globe, by allowing accurate identification and monitoring of ongoing events like erup- tions and fires even in remote locations, and by pinpointing and enabling quantitative tracking of regions of power outage and recovery following extreme weather events and geohazards in populated areas.  \\nEarth at Night tells-in the words of the women and men, the scientists and engineers who are actually designing the instruments and conducting the analyses of Earth\\'s nocturnal illumination imagery-the story of satellite measurements of global light in the night. It shows how ever-increasing instrument capability has improved the sensitivity, accuracy, coverage, and resolution of the observations. Through striking illustrations and clear explanations, the book summarizes many examples of analyses from the satellite nightlight data record-examples that themselves shine light on the ever-changing environment and our human impact on Earth.  \\nThis artful volume reaffirms our human ability to harness technology and science to observe and understand Earth for the benefit of all humankind. Above all, it once again illuminates the beauty and majesty of our home planet-at all hours.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Michael H.

In such images, patterns are imme- diately seen based on the presence or absence of light: a distinct coastline, bodies of water recognizable by their dark silhouettes, and the faint tendrils of roads and highways emanating from the brilliant blobs of light that are our modern, well-lit cities.  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/4)  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\\n:unselected:\\nBlue Marble Becomes Black Marble\\n===  \\n[Right] Dubbed the \"Blue Marble,\" this classic pho- tograph of Earth was taken by the Apollo 17 crew on December 7, 1972.  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/5)  \\n</figure>  \\nThe color of an object is actually the color of the light reflected while all other colors are absorbed. Most of the light that is reflected by clear, open ocean water is blue, while the red portion of sunlight is quickly absorbed near the surface. Therefore, very deep water with no reflections off the sea floor appears dark navy blue. Since approximately 70% of Earth\\'s surface is covered by deep ocean water, Earth appears as a blue marble when viewed from space during daytime hours. Clouds suspended in Earth\\'s atmosphere provide the white swirls.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"4\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/6)  \\n</figure>  \\nEnshrouded in nighttime darkness, however, Earth appears more as a black marble from space-one shimmering with light. The human search for light in darkness is long- standing. Many of our myths and religions focus on this search, yet it is only within the past century that humans have gained the ability to take flight-first to the skies and later into space-providing new vantage points from which to view Earth and the twinkling lights below, clearly visible at night.  \\nFor nearly 25 years, satellite images of Earth at night have served as a fundamental research tool, while also stoking public curiosity. These images paint an expansive and revealing picture, showing how humans have illuminated and shaped the planet in profound ways since the invention of the light bulb 140 years ago.  \\nThese lights and the darkness tell stories about our planet-stories that this volume will present for your consideration. Earth at Night will show how humans and natural phenomena light up the darkness, and how and why scientists have observed Earth\\'s nightlights for more than four decades using both their own eyes and spaceborne instruments. It is an engaging and fascinating story; come along for the adventure!  \\n[Above] NASA\\'s Black Marble. These images of Earth at night were created in 2012 over 9 days in April and 13 days in October. It took the Suomi National Polar- orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite 312 orbits and 2.5 terabytes of data to get a clear shot of every parcel of Earth\\'s land surface and islands. These new data were mapped over existing Blue Marble imagery to provide a realistic nighttime view of the planet.

Given the wide range of temperatures in the universe, it should be clear that electromagnetic radiation has wavelengths that span a very wide range.  \\nThe electromagnetic spectrum is the range of traveling waves of energy that run from very short gamma and X-rays through ultraviolet light, visible light, microwaves, and out to long radio waves. Visible light is the quite narrow band that human eyes are adapted to see. But as noted earlier, humans are proficient at developing tools to extend the range of their capabilities. Using sensors on orbiting satellites, designed to detect multiple spectral-band combinations, scientists can \"tune in\" to study various aspects of Earth\\'s surface in ways not possible from a simple color photograph.

It more fully describes the science-and art-of observing, identifying, and measuring an object without coming into direct contact with it. This process involves detecting and measuring radiation of different wavelengths emitted or reflected from distant objects or materials. Emitted light is comprised of photons in an excited state; for example, light coming from the Sun or a light bulb filament.

The Air Force, in particular, needed to provide more accurate and timely forecasts for pilots working at night over both land and sea.  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/11)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"PHE\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"11\" -->  \\n[Previous pages] Vintage photos of Earth at night- NASA\\'s Mercury-Atlas mission.

High clouds (white) are mixed with Earth\\'s nightlights (yel- low) on the right-hand side of the image, with Earth\\'s horizon on the left-hand side. The handwritten annotation at the top (that appears backwards in that photo) indicates this was the 348th photograph taken on the MA-4 mission. The next photograph (page 11) taken by MA-4, number 349, depicts an even darker scene of Earth at night. The white line in this photo is due to a film artifact.  \\nSo, scientists have observed Earth\\'s nightlights for more than four decades, first with astronaut photography and military satellites. Since the 1960s, the U.S. Air Force has operated the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), a series of 18 polar-orbiting satellites that observe clouds and other weather variables in key wavelengths of infrared and visible light. Starting in 1972, the DMSP satellites included the Operational Linescan System (OLS), which gives weather forecasters some ability to see in the dark.  \\nWhile DMSP has been a source of nighttime images for decades, until fairly recently the data were classified, which meant that only a few civilian scientists could conveniently gain access to study the data. The atmospheric science community was eager to have a more accessible night-vision tool to better understand weather and climate patterns and phenomena. Finally, in 2011, a new source of unclassified satellite images of Earth at night became available-one that improved upon the capabilities of OLS. The new low-light sensor was called the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and was launched in October 2011 onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite-a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Defense.  \\nVIIRS currently flies on Suomi NPP as well as on the NOAA-20 satellite (launched November 2017). The VIIRS \"Day/Night Band,\" or DNB, can observe dim light down to the scale of an isolated highway lamp or fishing boat. It can even detect faint, nocturnal atmospheric light-known as airglow-and observe clouds lit by it. Through the use of its DNB, VIIRS has made the first quantitative measurements of light emissions and reflections from Earth\\'s surface, distinguishing the intensity and the sources of nighttime light. The combination of these measurements gives us a global view of the human and natural light sources on Earth. Looking ahead, three more satellite missions are planned over the next decade, with a VIIRS instrument scheduled to be onboard each platform.  \\nThanks to advancements in sensor technology and improved optics, the VIIRS DNB is ten-to-fifteen times better than the OLS sensor at resolving the relatively dim  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"12\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/12)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"1980s\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n[Above] Early map of Earth at night.

These squares are called pixels-short for picture elements-and represent the amount of reflected or emitted light energy recorded for that part of the image. Each VIIRS pixel covers a distance of roughly 0.46 miles (742 meters) across, compared to the 1.86-mile (3-kilometer) footprint of OLS. To learn more about the technical details of OLS and VIIRS, see Appendix C.  \\nAs they have done since the dawn of the space age, astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS) also take photographs of Earth at night. In fact, their images have even higher spatial resolution than images from VIIRS (typically tens-to-hundreds of meters per pixel). However, unlike satellites, astronauts are not looking at Earth 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

Also, the ISS passes over a given point on Earth every two or three days and at variable times, while, for example, Suomi NPP flies over the same point twice a day at roughly the same time each day. With their complementary capabilities of spatial resolution, timing, and quantitative accuracy, scientists are interested in making joint observations with VIIRS and the ISS.  \\nWhile scientists use multiple spectral band combinations covering different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum-such as visible and infrared-during nighttime hours, this book focuses mainly on the detection of visible light at night.

Even the air and ocean some- times glow.  \\nThe \"Nature\\'s Light Shows\" and \"Human Light Sources\" sections of this book feature images of natural and anthropogenic light sources to illustrate how scientists use nightlight data to study our changing planet and how decision makers, in turn, can use the knowledge gained for public benefit. Some of these applications include forecasting a city\\'s energy use and carbon emissions, eradicating energy poverty and fostering sustainable energy development, providing immediate information when disasters strike, and monitoring the effects of conflict and population displacement.  \\n[Right] An astronaut onboard the International Space Station took this nighttime panorama while looking north across Pakistan\\'s Indus River valley.

Some of Earth\\'s most spectacular light shows are natural, like the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, in the Northern Hemisphere (aurora australis, or Southern Lights, in the Southern Hemisphere). The auroras are natural electrical phenomena caused by charged particles that race from the Sun toward Earth, inducing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere and creating the appearance of streamers of reddish or greenish light in the sky, usually near the northern or southern magnetic pole. Other natural lights can indicate danger, like a raging forest fire encroaching on a city, town, or community, or lava spewing from an erupting volcano.  \\nWhatever the source, the ability of humans to monitor nature\\'s light shows at night has practical applications for society. For example, tracking fires during nighttime hours allows for continuous monitoring and enhances our ability to protect humans and other animals, plants, and infrastructure. Combined with other data sources, our ability to observe the light of fires at night allows emergency managers to more efficiently and accurately issue warnings and evacuation orders and allows firefighting efforts to continue through the night. With enough moonlight (e.g., full-Moon phase), it\\'s even possible to track the movement of smoke plumes at night, which can impact air quality, regardless of time of day.  \\nAnother natural source of light at night is emitted from glow- ing lava flows at the site of active volcanoes. Again, with enough  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/31)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"September 17, 2011 SCHEDA 3003\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"28 Earth at Night\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/32)  \\n<figcaption>  \\n[Above] Astronauts onboard the International Space Station are treated to a spectacular display of the aurora australis while in orbit\\nover Southern New Zealand on September 17, 2011.  \\n</figcaption>  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"29\" -->  \\n[Opposite page] For the first time in perhaps a decade, Mount Etna experienced a \"flank eruption\" -erupting from its side instead of its summit-on December 24, 2018. The activity was accompanied by 130 earth- quakes occurring over three hours that morning. Mount Etna, Europe\\'s most active volcano, has seen periodic activity on this part of the mountain since 2013. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite acquired the main image of Mount Etna on December 28, 2018. The inset image highlights the active vent and thermal infrared signature from lava flows, which can be seen near the newly formed fissure on the southeastern side of the volcano. The inset was created with data from OLI and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8. Ash spewing from the fissure cloaked adjacent villages and delayed aircraft from landing at the nearby Catania airport. Earth- quakes occurred in the subsequent days after the initial eruption and displaced hundreds of people from their homes. For nighttime images of Mt. Etna\\'s March 2017 eruption, see pages 48-51.  \\nmoonlight, we can even track volcanic ash plumes, which can be hazardous to airplanes in flight. The ash, made up of tiny pieces of glass and rock, is abrasive to engine turbine blades and can melt on the blades and other engine parts, causing damage and even engine stalls, with consequent danger to the plane\\'s integrity and passenger safety. Vol- canic ash also reduces visibility for pilots and can cause etching of windshields, further reducing pilots\\' ability to see. Nightlight images can be combined with thermal images to give a more complete view of volcanic activity on Earth\\'s surface, as will be seen later.  \\nThe VIIRS DNB takes advantage of moonlight, airglow (the atmosphere\\'s self-illu- mination through chemical reactions), zodiacal light (sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust), and starlight from the Milky Way. By using these dim light sources, the DNB can detect changes in clouds, snow cover, and sea ice. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), orbit over Earth\\'s equator, offering uninterrupted observations of North America, whereas high-latitude areas such as Alaska benefit from polar-orbiting satellites like Suomi NPP. Polar-orbiting satellites provide significant overlapping coverage at the poles, enabling more data to be acquired in these regions. For exam- ple, during polar darkness (i.e., winter months), VIIRS DNB data allow scientists to observe sea ice formation and snow cover extent at the highest latitudes, in addition to spotting where there is clear water for ships to pass through.  \\nThe use of nightlight data by weather forecasters is growing as the VIIRS instrument can be used to see clouds at night when they are lit by moonlight and lightning. Scientists use nightlight data to study nighttime behavior of weather systems, including severe storms, which can develop and strike populous areas at night as well as during the day. Combined with thermal data, visible nightlight data can also be used to see clouds at various heights in the atmosphere at night, such as dense marine fog, which allows weather forecasters to issue marine advisories with higher confidence than ever before and, therefore, greater utility-see \"Marine Layer Clouds-California\" on page 56.  \\nIn this section of the book you will see how nightlight data are used to observe nature\\'s spectacular light shows across a wide range of sources.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/33)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"December 28, 2018 Mount Etna ash active vent thermal infrared signature ash Credit: USGS/NASA\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"31\" -->  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Fires\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/34)  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Fires\" -->'),\n",

Fishermen use the lights to attract plankton and fish, the preferred diet of com- mercially important squid. As the bait swims to the surface, the squid follow to feed and get caught by fishermen. The same fishing practices are used off the Atlantic coast of South America. The border between Thailand and neighboring Cambodia to the east is distinguished by a marked difference in the number of city lights. Cambodia is less urbanized and its popula- tion is smaller than that of neighboring countries. The majority of Cambodia\\'s population lives in rural farming areas where elec- tricity is sparse.  \\nHuman Light Sources\\n===  \\nV iewing Earth at night from space reveals a distinctly human story. As one gazes upon the points of light in images captured from orbiting sensors, discerning eyes begin to see the fingerprints of human presence: from the glow of megacities and the pinpoints of bright light produced by fleets of fishing boats at sea, to gas flares glowing like candles in the darkness, lights show where we have made our homes, established industries, mined natural resources, and built roads. Patterns are everywhere.  \\nIt quickly becomes evident looking at nightlight data that human activity is highly influenced by Earth\\'s natural features and processes, or physical geography. For example, the vital link between humans and water is quite clear. Nearly half the world\\'s population lives along or near coastlines. Others live along rivers and freshwater bodies. Most population centers tend to be along coastlines, near rivers, or near major over- land transportation hubs (e.g., highways, railroads) that cut slivers of light through the darkness between cities. In general, our species tends to avoid settling in regions with harsh climates (or if we do, we set about transforming them into something more pleasant), in mountainous areas with steep terrain, and where basic resources like food and water are limited (e.g., deserts). Accordingly, more light is clustered around regions where the climate is moderate, terrain is flat, resources are plentiful, and soil is fertile.  \\nAreas with the brightest light are generally the most urbanized-but not necessarily the most populated. When a city or country is thriving, electricity is used to keep businesses, schools, and factories bustling with activity. Lights show how far urban sprawl extends, as well as areas where growth is occurring or where growth has not yet occurred. Cities usually have many people concentrated in a small area, so electricity usage is high. Poor areas may have large populations but low availability or use of elec- tric lights. These signals from anthropogenic nightlights provide clear indicators of how we\\'ve settled our planet and-with some analysis-what we do with our energy.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"84 Earth at Night\" -->\\n:selected:<figure>  \\n![](figures/102)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"December 10, 2017 fishing boats Bangkok Phnom Penh Gulf of Thailand Andaman Sea ISS Robotic Arm N\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"85\" -->  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Urban Structure\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/103)  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Urban Structure\" -->'),\n",

The country also has 127,000 miles (204,000 kilometers) of railroad tracks and about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) of navigable rivers and canals (not includ- ing the Great Lakes).

The roadway map (bottom image, right) traces the path of the major interstate highways, railroads, and rivers of the United States. Comparing the two images, you quickly see how the cities and settlements align with the transportation corridors. In the early days of the republic, post roads and toll roads for horse-drawn carts and carriages were built to connect eastern cities like Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, though relatively few travelers made the long, unlit journeys. Railroads became the dominant trans- portation method for people and cargo in the middle of the nineteenth century, establishing longer links across the Nation and waypoints across the Midwest, the Great Plains, and the Rockies. Had nighttime satellite images existed in that era, they probably would show only dim pearls of light around major cities in the east and scattered across the country; the strands of steel tracks and cobbled roads that connected them would be invisible from space.  \\nEventually, cars and trucks became the dominant form of transportation in the United States. Drivers then needed roads and lighting to keep them safe on those roads. As the Nation grew in the twentieth century, the devel- opment of new cities and suburbs often conformed to the path of the interstate highways, adding light along the paths between the cities.  \\nOver the years, the length of navigable rivers has been a constant, as is their relative lack of light.

Daily nightlight data provide a new way of looking at how people use cities and the forces and patterns driving energy use.  \\n(images continue on pages 161-163)  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"160 Earth at Night\" -->  \\nHoliday Lights  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/210)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"2012 - 2014 Jacksonville Florida Orlando- Tampa Bay Gulf of Mexico -Miami N 100 km\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nHoliday Lighting  \\nless  \\nno change  \\nmore  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"161\" -->  \\nHoliday Lights  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/211)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\".\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n(cont\\'d from previous page)  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/212)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"2012 - 2014 Arkansas Dallas Shreveport Louisiana Texas Austin Houston San Antonio N 50 km\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nHoliday Lighting  \\nless  \\nno change  \\nmore  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"162 Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/213)  \\n</figure>  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/214)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"2012 - 2014 Nevada Las Vegas - California Arizona Los Angeles Phoenix San Diego - Tijuana N 50 km Mexico\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nHoliday Lighting  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"less\" -->  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"no change\" -->  \\nmore  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"163\" -->  \\nHoliday Lights  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Holiday Lights\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/215)  \\n</figure>'),\n",
       "  Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'The Lights of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr-Middle East'}, page_content='In December 2014, NASA researchers announced that they had detected significant changes in the amount and distribution of nighttime lighting during the holy month of Ramadan in the Middle East.  \\nThe maps on pages 165 and 166 show changes in lighting intensity and location on the Arabian Peninsula and in the countries along the eastern Mediterranean coast. They are based on data from the VIIRS DNB on the Suomi NPP satellite. These maps compare the nightlight signals from the months of Ramadan in 2012-2014 (parts of July and August in those years) to the average light output for the rest of 2012 to 2014. Green shading marks areas where light usage increased during the holy days; yellow marks areas with little change; and red marks areas where less light was used.  \\nA large increase in light output around the Egyptian capital Cairo corresponded with the holy month of Ramadan. The change made sense because Muslims fast during daylight in Ramadan, pushing meals, social gatherings, commerce, and other activities into nighttime hours. Peaks in light use closely tracked the Islamic calendar, as Ramadan shifted earlier in the summer each year.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"(cont\\'d on page 167)\" -->  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"164 Earth at Night\" -->  \\nHoliday Lights  \\n<figure>  \\n<figcaption>  \\n2012 - 2014  \\n</figcaption>  \\n![](figures/216)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Lebanon Beirut Mediterranean Sea Damascus Syria Tel Aviv -Amman \\\\*- Jerusalem Israel Jordan Cairo Egypt N 100 km\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nHoliday Lighting  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"less\" -->  \\nno change  \\nmore  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"165\" -->  \\nHoliday Lights  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/217)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"2012 - 2014 Saudi Arabia Riyadh Medina Red Sea Jeddah Mecca 100 km N\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nHoliday Lighting  \\nless  \\nno change  \\nmore  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"166 Earth at Night\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/218)  \\n</figure>  \\n(cont\\'d from page 164)  \\nLight use in Saudi Arabian cities, such as Riyadh and Jeddah, increased by 60 to 100 percent throughout the month of Ramadan. Light use in Turkish cities, however, increased far less. Some regions in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon did not have an increase in light output-and some even demonstrated a moderate decrease, possibly due to unstable electrical grids and conflict in the region. Even within majority Muslim popu- lations, there are a lot of variations. Lighting patterns track cultural variation within the Middle East.  \\nThese variations appear even at the neighborhood level. Some of the poorest and most devout areas observed Ramadan without significant increases in light use throughout the month, choosing-whether for cultural or financial reasons-to leave their lights off at night.  \\nHowever, during the Eid al-Fitr celebration that marks the end of Ramadan, light use soared across all study groups, as all the neighborhoods appeared to join in the festivities. Energy use patterns seem to reflect social and cultural identities, as well as the habits of city dwellers, and not just price or other commercial factors.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"167\" -->  \\nHoliday Lights  \\nEpilogue\\n===  \\nO :unselected: ver the last 50 years of the space program we have had the opportunity to view planet Earth not only during the day but also at night. As so many astronauts have remarked, seeing the day-lit Earth from space changes our per- spective. We move away from feeling like local or regional creatures, living in countries, states, and towns, towards a new perspective of becoming citizens of the whole world. This shift in awareness is because the day-lit Earth shows no artificial boundaries created by humans to separate different societies and political systems. But this perspective changes at night, when we see the places on Earth where progress has produced vivid displays of lights.  \\nEarth evolves through a process of dynamical change. This evolution surely includes human inhabitants, since we live, work, multiply, and migrate within Earth\\'s biosphere on a continual basis. Throughout human history on Earth, civilizations have come and gone due to natural disasters, long-term climate change, and the con- sequences of large meteorite impacts.  \\nWhat will Earth at night look like from space in the next 50 years? Will there be new and sprawling cities where today there are none? Will natural disasters destroy densely populated areas we see today, turning them into dark, forbidden areas at night? Surely all these things will happen to some extent.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"168 Earth at Night\" -->  \\nChances are Earth at night will only get brighter with more complex webs of lights strung all over the planet. This shows progress and is important for sustaining life, but my hope is that there will still be places where the darkness is treasured, and where we can continue to look outward to the planets, stars, and beyond.  \\nJames L.

       "  Document(metadata={'Header 2': \"NASA's Black Marble Product Suite\"}, page_content='NASA\\'s Black Marble product suite provides estimates of daily nighttime lights and other intrinsic surface optical properties of Earth at night. The product is based on the Day/Night Band (DNB) sensor of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite. The VIIRS DNB is a highly sensitive, low-light sensor capable of measuring daily global nighttime light emissions and reflections, allowing users to identify sources and intensi- ties of these artificial lights, and monitor changes over a period of time. Like any opti- cal sensor, the principal challenge in using VIIRS DNB data is to account for variations in light captured by the sensor. Certainly, there are variations in the sources and inten- sity of anthropogenic light due to changing human processes like urbanization, oil and gas production, nighttime commercial fishing, and infrastructure development. However, these processes can only be studied when other naturally-occurring factors that influence nighttime lights are removed. For example, variations in lunar lighting due to consistent changes in Moon phase cause fluctuations in the amount of light shining on Earth. Similarly, land-cover dynamics (e.g., seasonal vegetation, snow and ice cover), as well as atmospheric conditions (e.g., clouds, aerosols, airglow, and auroras), influence the intensity of the light captured by the sensor as it travels over various parts of the world.  \\nTo realize the full potential of the VIIRS DNB time series record for nighttime lights applications, NASA\\'s Black Marble product suite was developed, building on a history of 20 years of research on how light changes when it reflects off of surfaces with dif- ferent angular and spectral properties. Through complex modeling, scientists can now predict how moonlight, snow, vegetation, terrain, and clouds impact the lights we  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"170 Earth at Night\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/219)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Moonlight Stray light SAA hits Path Radiance At-Sensor Radiance Airglow Cloud masking + Atmospheric Correction Reflected Lunar/Glow Radiance Surface Reflectance Seasonal Vegetation and Snow Correction\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nsee. The Black Marble product suite removes these extraneous effects and creates consistent daily records of man-made lighting (see figure above). The product ingests multiple sources of ancillary data to output the highest-quality, pixel-based estimates of nighttime lights.  \\nWith these corrections in nighttime radiances, we get a superior view of nighttime lights with frequent observations and reduction in background noise, enabling various quantitative analyses of daily, seasonal, and annual changes, in an analysis-ready file format. Products are calibrated across time, validated against ground measurements, and include quality indicators so that they can be used effectively and accurately in science and applications studies.  \\nThe product is routinely made available from NASA\\'s Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), and can be freely accessed through NASA\\'s EarthData portal: https://urs.earthdata. nasa.gov/home. The standard product is available at 500-meter spatial resolution since  \\n[Left] Overview of NASA\\'s Black Marble product retrieval process. During the portion of the lunar cycle when moonlight is present at the time of satel- lite observation, the surface upward radiance from artificial light emissions (shown in red) can be extracted from at-sensor radiance (white lines with arrows towards satellite). The Black Marble product suite removes several nat- ural sources that influence the at-sensor radiance, including airglow, moonlight, snow and seasonal vegeta- tion, stray light, and clouds.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"171\" -->  \\nJanuary 2012 and is being processed on a daily basis within 3-5 hours after acquisition, enabling both near-real-time uses and long-term monitoring applications. Detailed information on product generation, applications, and documentations can be found at the product\\'s website (https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov).  \\nThese products are not just pretty maps of Earth at night. They provide a global nighttime, environmental-science-quality product needed for all major disciplines that focus on the nocturnal environment, with emphasis on targeted studies of phenomena related to, for example, light pollution, urbanization science, disaster response, clouds and aerosols, and the ocean at night, as well as various applications like energy access, disaster risk reductions, and resilience. These daily records are invaluable to city planners, ecologists, economists, and emergency responders assessing damage after major storms like Hurricane Maria (discussed on pages 118-121 of this volume). Since light at night is a primarily human-created phenomenon, these products will improve our understanding of human processes that take place on the land and ocean, and interactions between human systems and the environment.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"172 Earth at Night\" -->'),\n",

A key instrument on Suomi NPP is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which is a multispectral instrument that scans 1889-mile- (3040-kilometer-) wide swaths of data.  \\n1  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/220)  \\n<figcaption>  \\nVIIRS instrument\\nactive scanning swath  \\n</figcaption>  \\n</figure>  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/221)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"2\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/222)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"nighttime swath\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nThe Suomi NPP satellite observes Earth\\'s surface throughout the day-and at night. The Day/Night Band (DNB) of the VIIRS instrument detects light in a range of wavelengths from green (500 nanometers) to near-infrared (900 nanometers) and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights-down to the scale of an isolated highway lamp-wildfires, gas flares, auroras, and reflected moonlight at night. In this example (above), the satellite acquired a swath of data during nighttime hours over portions of South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Eastern United States.  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"173\" -->\\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/223)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"3\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/224)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"nighttime swaths 1 2 3\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\nEvery day, swaths of data-acquired during day and night hours-can be stitched together to create daytime and nighttime images of Earth.

The BMNG was then modified to appear more \"night-like\" to highlight Earth\\'s land surfaces. The land appears in shades of dark blue and the ocean appears black. The Black Marble global composite image was tinted yellow to closely match the actual appearance of lights from space. The night-like background and Black Marble global composite images were then combined to produce this image of Earth at night.  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/228)  \\n<!-- FigureContent=\"Final combination of the night- like background and yellow- tinted Black Marble global composite images.

The only anthropogenic visible light source that is not always easily detected by the VIIRS DNB is light from LED bulbs. For example, white LED bulbs peak near 450 nanometers, and therefore return dimmer signals. Despite this limitation, VIIRS DNB is highly sensitive to very low amounts of light; it can sense light 100,000 times fainter than conven- tional visible-light sensors.  \\nUnlike cameras that many use every day to capture a scene in one complete expo- sure, VIIRS produces an image by repeatedly scanning a scene (increasing exposure time) and resolving it as millions of individual picture elements, or pixels. The DNB goes a step further, determining on the fly whether to use its low-, medium-, or high- gain mode. If a pixel is very bright, the low-gain mode on the sensor prevents the pixel from oversaturating. If the pixel is dark, the signal will be amplified.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"178 Earth at Night\" -->  \\nAppendix D\\n===  \\nAdditional Credits and Information Black Marble: front and back covers, endpapers, ii, iii, ix, 2, 3, 5, 13, 26, 27, 114, 115, 120, 121, 128, 129, 139, 140-143, 158, 159, 161-163, 165, 166, 170-172, 174  \\nNASA\\'s Earth Observatory: 9, 14-25, 30-43, 46-119, 122-167  \\nInternational Space Station (ISS): xvi, 1, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 50, 55, 60-66, 72, 73, 78-81, 85, 87, 89-95, 97, 98, 100-103, 111-113, 116, 117  \\nFor more information Black Marble https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights  \\nBlack Marble Science Team https://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/#people  \\nNASA\\'s Earth Observatory https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov  \\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01\\\\_intro https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html  \\n<!-- PageNumber=\"179\" -->  \\n<figure>  \\n![](figures/231)  \\n</figure>  \\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  \\nwww.nasa.gov NP-2019-07-2739-HQ')],\n",
