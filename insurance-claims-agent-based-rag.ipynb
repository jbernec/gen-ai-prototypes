I'll utilize a template form that includes detailed sections on accident location, incident description, involved vehicles, and injury information.\n",

Further refining the responses can be accomplished by applying additional preprocessing to the claims documents to better maintain context between the tables and associated texts. \n",

The weather was foggy, and traffic was moving slowly due to congestion. As I approached a stop, I braked gently to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of me.Suddenly, I felt a jolt from behind as Mark Johnson, who was driving a delivery van (License Plate: 8XYZ456), collided with the rear of my vehicle. The impact caused damage to the rear bumper and trunk of my car. I was wearing my seatbelt and did not sustain any injuries, but I was shaken by the incident.Mark exited his vehicle to check on me, and we exchanged insurance information. I have attached a copy of the police report, which was filed at the scene, along with photographs of the damage to both vehicles.## INSURED VEHICLEYear2010Make HondaModel CivicV.I.N. 1HGCM82633A123456Plate7ABC123Extent of Damages Damage to rear bumper, Scratches on trunkPresent Location Impound LotDriver Emily Rodriguez\n\u001B[32m**********************************************************************\u001B[0m\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u001B[33mAISearchAssistant\u001B[0m (to User):\n\nBased on the search results, the party liable for the damages in the accident that happened on Lombard Street is Mark Johnson, who was driving a delivery van. The explanation for this liability is that Mark Johnson collided with the rear of Emily Rodriguez's vehicle, causing damage to the rear bumper and trunk of her car. The police report and photographs of the damage support this account. Rear-end collisions typically place liability on the driver who struck from behind, as they are expected to maintain a safe distance and control their vehicle to avoid such impacts.\n\nTERMINATE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
